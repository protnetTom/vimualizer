# ✨ Vimualizer

### *Don't just type. Visualize.*

**Vimualizer** is the missing HUD for your macOS workflow. It turns your obscure Vim muscle memory into a real-time, human-readable light show on your screen.

Whether you're demoing code, streaming, or just checking if you actually typed `ciw` or `diw`, Vimualizer has your back.

## ⚡️ The Engine (Prerequisites)

Vimualizer rides on the back of the legendary **Hammerspoon** automation engine.

### 1. Grab the Hammer 🔨

You need Hammerspoon installed to run the magic.

* **Via Homebrew (The cool way):**
    ```bash
    brew install --cask hammerspoon
    ```
* **Manual Download:**
  Grab it from [Hammerspoon.org](https://www.hammerspoon.org/).

### 2. Unlock the Gates 🔓

Vimualizer listens to your keyboard to translate those sweet, sweet Vim chords.

1. Open **Hammerspoon**.
2. Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Accessibility**.
3. Flip the switch for **Hammerspoon** to **ON**. ✅

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Find the Bunker

Open your terminal and jump to the config directory:
`~/.hammerspoon`

*(Empty? Just launch Hammerspoon once and it’ll build the house for you.)*

### 2. Drop the Payload

1. Create a file named `init.lua` inside that folder.
2. **Paste the entire Vimualizer script** into it.
3. Save. 💾

> **Pro Tip:** Already a Hammerspoon power user? Save our script as `vimualizer.lua` and just add `require("vimualizer")` to your existing `init.lua`. Clean code, happy life.

### 3. Ignite

1. Click the **Hammerspoon icon** in your menu bar.
2. Hit **Reload Config**.
3. Look for the alert: *"Vimualizer Loaded"*. You are now live.

## 📦 Automated Installation

We provide a helper script to automate the setup process. This script handles dependency installation (Homebrew, Hammerspoon) and configuration file placement.

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: Use at your own risk.**
This script makes changes to your system configuration and overwrites your Hammerspoon `init.lua` file. Always review scripts before running them on your machine.

### Instructions

1. Download `init.lua` (the Vimualizer source code) and `install.sh` to the same folder.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to that folder.
3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```
4. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
5. Launch **Hammerspoon** from your Applications folder.

*Note: If you already use Hammerspoon, your existing config will be backed up to `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua.bak`.*

## 🎮 How to Drive

| Action | Trigger | The Vibe |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Control Panel** | `Cmd` + `Opt` + `P` | Opens the settings. Tweak it til it breaks. |
| **Move the HUD** | **Drag & Drop** | Grab the "DRAG ME" handle. Put it anywhere. |
| **Instant Feedback** | **Type Code** | Watch your keystrokes appear like magic. |

### 🎛 The Settings Panel

* **💾 Save:** Hits the disk. We store your layout in `~/Documents/Vimualizer/settings.json` so your setup survives a reboot.
* **🚫 Exclusions:** Terminal already has Vim? Add it to the **Exclusion List** and Vimualizer will sleep when that app is focused.
* **🔎 Zoom:** Text too small? Pump up the font size with the `+` buttons.

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

**HUD plays hide and seek?**
macOS permissions can be finicky. Toggle the **Accessibility** permission for Hammerspoon **OFF** and then **ON** again. It’s the "turn it off and on again" of the 21st century.

**Escape key jailed?**
If hitting `Esc` feels like it's hitting a wall, make sure you pasted the *latest* version of the script. We fixed the event taps so your Escape key runs free.

**Settings forgot you?**
We try to auto-create `~/Documents/Vimualizer`, but if your Mac is on lockdown, you might need to make that folder yourself.
